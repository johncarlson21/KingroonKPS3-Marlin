# KingroonKPS3-Marlin
Marlin 2.0.1x for KPS3 with 1.3 board using the GD32 F303 chip

This is built from the Marlin 2.0.x bugfix branch.
At the time the configuration file version was: CONFIGURATION_H_VERSION 02010000

It has the advanced pause feature implemented so you can use the M600 code in your gcode print files.

Remember to level your bed and set your esteps etc!

# Install:
Download Robin_nano.bin
Copy to SD Card
Insert into printer and power on
Initialize EEPROM

After about 45 seconds your install will finish. The install also removes the firmware file from the SD Card.
After install and initialization, your settings are saved on your SD Card in the file: ROBIN_NANO.CUR and must stay on the card.

# I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PRINTER IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG OR BRICK IT BECAUSE YOUR MACHINE DOES NOT USE THIS EXACT SETUP!
